# Firebase_otp

 Flutter + Firebase project.

## Getting Started

This is the task given to me for the role of Android Developer (Flutter Intern).

# Flutter Intern Task Description:
1. You have to create a small app with OTP authentication(you have to take mobile no, OTP as input from the
user and verify the OTP and then users log in). Use firebase for OTP Authentication.
2. The home page of the app should contain g-maps where it should ask you to select a destination location
3. After selecting the destination location, now the app should open Gmaps app in your mobile
4. The Gmaps app should display the route between your current location and the selected location.
5. Also a logout button should be there in the app to logout from the app.

# Note
âž” In the flutter app the code should be written neatly and should be easily understandable so try to seperate APIs
calling from the UI part, try to add comments for easy understanding.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
